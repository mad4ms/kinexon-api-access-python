# Kinexon Cloud Authentication Script

Welcome to the Kinexon Cloud Authentication Script. This script performs a two-step authentication process and fetches available games from the Kinexon Cloud. 
Currently a **WIP**.
## Features
- **Popup Authentication:** Log in through a popup URL because why have one login step when you can have two?
- **Main Site Authentication:** Log in to the main site after the popup, because who doesn't love redundancy?
- **Fetch Metrics and Events:** Retrieve a list of available metrics and events. Because that's what you actually wanted, right?
- **Fetch Position files of Games:** That's what I actually wanted, so here we are.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip:

```
pip install requests
```

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables with your actual credentials and API information:

```

export POPUP_USERNAME='your_popup_username'
export POPUP_PASSWORD='your_popup_password'
export MAIN_USERNAME='your_main_username'
export MAIN_PASSWORD='your_main_password'
export KINEXON_API_KEY='your_api_key'
```

### Running the Script
Once your environment variables are set, run the script:

```
python main.py
```
And voila! Watch as the script logs you in twice (because once is never enough) and fetches your precious metrics and events.

### Troubleshooting
- Failed to Login: Double-check your credentials. Check with the webiste. We all make typos.
- Connection Errors: Ensure you have an internet connection. Yes, itâ€™s necessary.
- Might be prone to API changes due to young age of Kinexon API
